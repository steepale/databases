# Building databases

# Objective on April 25th, 2017 is to annotate somatic snvs and indels with rs numbers from dbSNP.
# Will download VCF files with rs numbers from dbSNP and annotate in house

# dbSNP

# Here is a download of the dbSNP file:
wget -r -np -nH ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/chicken_9031/VCF/*
