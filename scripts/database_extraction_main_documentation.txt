# Building databases

# Objective on April 25th, 2017 is to annotate somatic snvs and indels with rs numbers from dbSNP
# Will download VCF files with rs numbers from dbSNP and annotate in house

# dbSNP
cd /home/users/a.steep/databases/dbsnp

# Info about dbSNP as of April 25, 2017
#Last Updated: Build 147 (Apr 14, 2016)
#RefSNP Count: 21.3 Million
#SubSNP Count: 57.4 Million
#Assembly: Gallus_gallus-5.0
#Data: Search, FTP
#Genome Data Viewer: Gallus_gallus-5.0

# Here is a download of the dbSNP file:
wget -r -np -nH ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/chicken_9031/VCF/*
# VCF files in /home/users/a.steep/databases/dbsnp/snp/organisms/chicken_9031/VCF

# Return home
cd /home/users/a.steep/databases

# Downloaded a ncbi chicken gene annotation file from ncbi ftp on may 7th, 2017
